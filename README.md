## Reflection on the Process
Throughout the past few months, I have been intrigued by the cultural role that typical day-to-day documents play in creating cultural heritage, from FMCGs (fast-moving consumer goods) to documents and money. It has become ever more interesting when my parents showed me some of the old documents my grandparents had.
The documents give the reader an insight into what the lives of those people were like. It included some of the trade they did, how much they paid for things, buying pieces of land, and small details that no one would hear about unless they are told.
I felt there is a window to start recording seemingly unimportant pieces of family history; contracts, IDs, and even birth certificates.
